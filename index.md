## For New Learners

Definitely take a look at our [Learning Resources](learning_resources.html), and
by our, I mean *our*! You can [submit your own changes via
GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/edit/gh-pages/learning_resources.md)
to keep our learning resources current.

If you have no idea where to go, drop us a line on the [py4science
list](mailto:py4science@lists.berkeley.edu), or visit, call, or email us at the
[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)!

Also check us out on Twitter:

## Join The Community!

**Social Computing** is a bi-weekly meeting in the
[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/location) providing a social setting focused on
social science and computing. You are also welcome if you aren't quite a social
scientist. All events are announced via the mailing list, and [the mailing list
archive *is* the website for the
group](https://www.mail-archive.com/socialcomputing@lists.berkeley.edu/).

**The Hacker Within** supports the development of your inner hacker, in a weekly
meeting in [BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu/about/directions-and-travel) for
sharing skills and best practices for scientific computation. You can find out
more on [their website](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/).

The Python Work(ers) Party is now relegated to [the
archives](/events/archives.html)!

The py4science mailing list is still functional, but please subscribe to the
Social Computing or The Hacker Within mailing lists for the events in those
groups.  While there are often better resources (like [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even just Google), the Berkeley Python
community is always happy to get you moving in the right direction.
