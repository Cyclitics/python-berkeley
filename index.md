## Want to Learn Python?

Learn Python is a working group at UC Berkeley, sponsored by the D-Lab (356 Barrows Hall). We hold informal weekly meetings about fundamentals & special topics of the [Python programming language](https://python.org/). We focus especially in social science applications, data science, and visualization. 

This group is perfect for those who are new to Python. Much of the learning will be done in pairs or as a team. Everyone is welcome to attend any or all meetings throughout the semester.

**When:** Mondays from 4-5:30, **staring 9/12**.

Please email facilitator [Megan Carey](mailto:mcarey@berkeley.edu) for more information. You can also [subscribe here](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/learnpython@lists.berkeley.edu) to our mailing list!
