## For New Learners

Definitely take a look at our [Learning Resources](learning_resources.html), and
by our, I mean *our*! You can [submit your own changes via
GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/edit/gh-pages/learning_resources.md)
to keep our learning resources current.

If you have no idea where to go, drop us a line on the [py4science
list](mailto:py4science@lists.berkeley.edu), or visit, call, or email us at the
[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)!

Also check us out on Twitter:

## Join The Community!

When we're in session, we keep track of our meetings on our [events
page](/events). We'll likely start up again on January 16, but watch this space
for more info!

Upcoming events, and links to our mailing list and calendar are always available
in the side bar at the right (or above on mobile/narrow browsers). **All are
welcome!** Sometimes there are better resources (like [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even just Google), but the Berkeley
Python community is always happy to get you moving in the right direction.
