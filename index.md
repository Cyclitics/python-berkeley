## Want to Learn Python?

Learn Python is a meeting group at UC Berkeley, sponsored by the D-Lab (356 Barrows Hall). We hold informal weekly meetings about fundamentals & special topics of the [Python programming language](https://python.org/). We focus especially in social science, data science, and visualization. 

This group is perfect for learners who are new to Python. You'll have a group of peers instead of being by yourself. Everyone is welcome to attend any or all meetings throughout the semester.

**Weekly meeting time and date is TBD.** Please email facilitator [Megan Carey](mailto:mcarey@berkeley.edu) for more information. You can also [subscribe here](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/learnpython@lists.berkeley.edu) to our mailing list!
