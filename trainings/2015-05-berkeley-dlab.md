title: Berkeley D-Lab -- May 2015
---
# Potential instructors

Currently, this training is being organized here (via pull requests), and on the
related [issue on the github
tracker](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/issues/37).

Below is an incomplete schematic of what the course will approximately look like,
instructors for each day. Again, I'd like to have a short party at the end.

A sign-up page still needs to be made on the D-Lab site.

## Getting ready

We'll use the most recent version of BCE for VirtualBox. Links and instructions are
[here](http://bce.berkeley.edu/install.html). NOTE - BCE MAY
BE UPDATED PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP! PLEASE CHECK BACK THE WEEK BEFORE!

And, while you're looking ahead to our training, check out our [Learning
Resources](learning_resources.html).

## Join The Community!

We keep track of our *Friday 2:30-4:30pm Social Computing meetings* on our [mailing
list](https://www.mail-archive.com/socialcomputing@lists.berkeley.edu).
**We'll also have a short meeting right after the Friday class.**

Upcoming events, and links to our mailing list and calendar, along with our
sister organization, The Hacker Within, are always available in the side bar at
the right (or above on mobile/narrow browsers). All are welcome! Sometimes there
are better resources (like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even
just Google), but the Berkeley Python community is always happy to get you
moving in the right direction.
