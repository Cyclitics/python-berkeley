## Join The Community!

We keep track of our *Friday 4-6pm meetings* (this summer, about *every other
week*) on our [events page](/events). We'll have a meeting right after the
Friday class.

Upcoming events, and links to our mailing list and calendar are always available
in the side bar at the right (or above on mobile/narrow browsers). All are
welcome! Sometimes there are better resources (like [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even just Google), but the Berkeley
Python community is always happy to get you moving in the right direction.

Check out the [Python Workers'
Party](events/2014/01/24/python-workers-party-rally.html) announcement for the
current history of the Berkeley Python community, including our
zany/revolutionary python party graphic!
