### Son and/or Daughter, we need to hack...

[Some weeks
ago](http://python.berkeley.edu/events/2014/02/28/getting-things-done-with-pandas.html),
Chris Holdgraf and I said we wanted to do some hacking on pandas -- really easy
stuff that will make everyone's life better. But, we didn't get around to it!

Then, Will Stein came by and told us about this awesome [IPython extension to do
Sage's convenience
pre-parsing](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/src/sage/misc/sage_extension.py).
Sure, it's the kind of thing that will make some people cringe, but it goes some
way towards complaints that python makes you type a lot of stuff.

All we need to do is open a repo with a name (which might [be
hard](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)!), put that code in
there, et voil√†, we've got this crazy new extension for everyone. And we'll need
to factor out the other dependencies from Sage, but how hard can that be?
