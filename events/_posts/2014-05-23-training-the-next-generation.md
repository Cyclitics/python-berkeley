title: Training the next generation of Pythonistas!
author: Dav Clark
---

This week, I'll get your input and kick the tires on my [Python Intensive
curriculum](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals) that [I'll be
teaching next week in the
D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/programming-fundamentals) (preceded by
a ["what is programming?"](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/python-intensive-0)
workshop).

I'd love to get your input, but *even more* I'd love it if **you can assist
teaching!** I especially need someone for **Tuesday: 10am-noon for programming
FUNdamentals** and **1-4pm for the Python Intensive.** But we can also use folks
Wed-Fri from 1-4pm.

### Updating the Site

Note that I updated [last weeks event](/events/2014/05/16/packaging-discussion.html) with links to the presentations (and the
links to ipynb files are automatically munged w/ nbviewer links via some
[moderately brittle javascript](/assets/nbview.js)).

**Anyone** can update the site via a pull request on GitHub! You'll get points, and
can compete with some of these [heavy hitters](/points).

That's right - the Python Workers' Party has it's own digital currency, and you
can even **mine your own points** using pull requests (and *ask* if you don't
know how!). But please use this power responsibly.
