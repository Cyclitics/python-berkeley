### Python Koans

This Friday, I propose an exploration of ["Koans" for learning
python](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) (and potentially other
programming languages / frameworks). It turns out there's a whole internet
subculture dedicated to this "test-driven learning" idea that I've been talking
about with some of you!

As per usual, [the Hitchiker's Guide to
Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest) [already knew about
this](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/#python-koans).

Thanks to @ivanov for finding this, and yes, the Koan idea was started
by a Rubyist...

The python guide suggests the following links to find more koans [on
GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=koans&ref=cmdform) and [on
BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/repo/all?name=koans).
