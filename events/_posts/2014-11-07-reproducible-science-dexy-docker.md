title: Reproducible Science with Dexy and Docker
author: Dav Clark
---
### Documenting complex scientific workflows

@ananelson will give us an overview of using [Dexy](http://dexy.it) with
[Docker](http://docker.io). Ana is the primary author of Dexy, so it doesn't get
any more authoritative than this!

If there's interest, we may discuss some of the recent moves towards using the
[Berkeley Common Environment](http://collaboratool.berkeley.edu/using-bce.html)
with Docker.
