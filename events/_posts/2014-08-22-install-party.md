### Welcome the new Pythonistas

We've got a group of new Python programmers who've been working hard all week.
Please show up, share your knowledge, and help them orient on the path that
lets them dig into their research!

Perhaps now is also a good time to have a look at our own [learning
resources](learning_resources.html) and add your wisdom there as well?

### Coming up: Xray

Coming up in two weeks, we'll continue with our exploration of high performance
numberical data structures with a presentation on [Xray](http://xray.readthedocs.org/).

And just in case I've deprived you of some of the serendipitous fun you might
have found if you googled "python xray", check out [these pythons](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+xray&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=779&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=myD2U9iXDuS8igL5hoG4Cw&ved=0CEIQsAQ)!
