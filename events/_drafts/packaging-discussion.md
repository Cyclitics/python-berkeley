### Why is packaging so hard?

The scientific python community has had a long and difficult path with packaging
-- largely because we build complex codes that use lots of "foreign" languages
like fortran and C.

### Enter Conda

So, the guys at continuum created conda to solve their own packaging problems.
They even released it as open source [on GitHub]().

### Matthew Brett wheel give us the answers!

Or at least he knows something about building [wheels]().

### Other packaging projects

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CefoqK8Qlno) by Roman
Shaposhnik who created the Apache BigTop project for packaging up the Hadoop
ecosystem that may have some interesting parallels. And [the
slides](http://www.slideshare.net/buildacloud/deploying-hadoop-based-bigdata-environments-roman-shaposhnik)
to go with it.

### Honorable mention
