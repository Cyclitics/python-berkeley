## For New Learners

Here is a great list of resources when getting started with Python:

#### Start here!

[Start with this 10-minute tutorial.](https://try-python.appspot.com/) When it
loads, type `tutorial` and press Enter to start.

```{python}
def hi():
    print("hello world")
```

## Set up your computer

This is our recommended way to install Python on your system.

#### Install Anaconda

* Please [download the Anaconda installer](http://continuum.io/downloads). We recommend Python 3.
* Choose `Install for me only`
* By default, Anaconda will prepend itself to your PATH -- leave this as is
* When Anaconda has finished installing, open a terminal (Linux, OSX), or the Anaconda Prompt (Windows)
* Type `conda update conda`, hit enter, and then say "y"
* Type `conda update anaconda`, hit enter, and then say "y"

#### Run Jupyter

With Jupyter, you intersperse code, output, explanatory text, and figures in one big file called a "notebook." Notebooks are a convenient format to explore a language and to share examples of code, but should not be used to write programs.

* To run a notebook, open the Terminal (Linux, OSX) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows) and type `jupyter notebook`. 
* The notebook will open a new tab in your default browser. **Do not close the terminal**, as this will also shutdown the notebook. 
* When it has loaded, click on "New" (at the top right) and then "Python3" to create a new notebook.

#### Text editors

For writing code in Python, we recommend the use of a text editor in combination with IPython and a testing suite. Popular choices include:

* [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/)

#### IDEs

For more complicated projects, a well-engineered IDE may be better than a text editor. Typically, IDEs include support for visual debugging and code refactoring. Popular choices include:

* [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/installation.html)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/)

#### Python 2 vs Python 3

Python 3 (released in 2008) is the newest version of Python, and most features
have not changed. Most packages have been updated to Python 3 by now (2016).
So, if your lab does not have a preference, I recommend using Python 3.

There are a couple key differences for novice programmers:

* In Python 2, you can print with `print 42` or `print(42)`. In Python
  3, you need to use parentheses, as in `print(42)`.
* In Python 2, division of two integers like `5/2` will evaluate to
  `2`. (Python will drop the remainder if both numbers are integers.)
  Python 3 does exact division (in this example, `2.5`).
    * If you use Python 2 and do not want this behavior, add this line at the
      top of each program: `from __future__ import division`.
