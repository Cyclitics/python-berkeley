### Info
Today we will be learning how to use the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library.

### Materials
The notebook can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3D_PdrFcBfRZ0ZlOGdQczlRREE?usp=sharing), but be sure to download it right before class to ensure you have the most updated version! We are often working on these up until class begins.
