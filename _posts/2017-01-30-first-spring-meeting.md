### Info
What's the big deal about Python? Stop by on **Monday, January 30 from 4-5:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**). The first meeting will kick off the working group, with a brief review of Python and an introduction to [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). After, we'll do a meet and greet to see how others use Python in an academic setting, and set up discussion topics for the next few meetings.

### Materials
The Jupyter notebook can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3D_PdrFcBfRM2EtcHBOXzA4UVE), and the slides can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cMe-rSJRHpUDebl_aP78zQUJPL5Xzs0TS0k31gOGWt4).

Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
