Come on **Monday, April 18 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today, we will continue exploring the possibilities of Python on the web via APIs. This is a follow-up of last week's project with the NYTimes. Please see what we did [two weeks ago (especially the lesson notes)](../2016-04-04-python-and-apis). We will try to ask some interesting questions about NYTimes articles, and hopefully produce a plot with some of the visualization tools we checked out earlier in the semester. (Things are starting to come together!)

Please do, at minimum, run through the [beginner tutorial](http://try-python.appspot.com) and try to follow the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer). Also, we&#39;d love if you can go through [these exercises](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.html). If you get stuck, we can help: [email me here](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or stop by the D-Lab in 356 Barrows.
