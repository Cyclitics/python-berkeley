## Overview
Today, we will go over some of the basics of the Python language. We will learning about Python syntax, data types, and how to write function definitions.

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1miRUsJYo9i2FlbPkyCwUR5pNaARXo8UoGpHEvCNVQ80/edit?usp=sharing), and the Jupyter Notebook download [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3D_PdrFcBfRRXlqM1huQjMzalNXN09EeFNPTHdJR3dyRG1N).

Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
