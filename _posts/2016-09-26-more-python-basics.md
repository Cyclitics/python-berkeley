## Overview
Today, we will go over more basics of the Python language, with more emphasis on function definitions and other data types.

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1undT79Ks0NBN5HW4PJsjYg3RI5yBCxlNp37XPzt1y6o/edit?usp=sharing), and the Jupyter Notebook download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRcGpybHhVTkRMZFE/view?usp=sharing).

Will this be your first week in the working group? Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
