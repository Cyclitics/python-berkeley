Come on **Monday, March 28 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today, we will discuss the use of Python in a programming project. We will brainstorm some ideas, and also look at open Python projects that other groups are working on. We will also discuss using Git and Github for version control and collaboration. This is the day to attend if you want to build something in a collaborative manner.

Please do, at minimum, run through the [beginner tutorial](http://try-python.appspot.com) and try to follow the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer). Also, we&#39;d love if you can go through [these exercises](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.html). If you get stuck, we can help: [email me here](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or stop by the D-Lab in 356 Barrows.
