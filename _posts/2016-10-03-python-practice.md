## Overview
Today, we will be practicing the Python basics learned in previous weeks. We will also cover a few more advanced topics.

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TL7wj3KicMrGO4Eni2V6IJVAd4OPbWlQvl_gRMhY3Zk/edit?usp=sharing), and the Jupyter Notebook download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRNVFyeTNOMlBKRWs/view?usp=sharing). Solutions for the in-class challenges are now included in the notebook!

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRaUVVSk83a19jUjA/view?usp=sharing) are some practice problems to work on before class (totally optional!). Download the notebook of solutions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRMktPSkVHamVQN0U/view?usp=sharing).

Will this be your first week in the working group? Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
