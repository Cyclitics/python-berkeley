## Overview
Today, we will begin our project for the semester! We will be learning about APIs and exploring the various CDC databases.

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1abAVezGYUYj4MZ_TubGkOKQJ9d6wmiPx9GUkvmaqnuU/edit?usp=sharing), and the Jupyter Notebook download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRd3JVWC1nS1FfdDQ/view?usp=sharing).

Will this be your first week in the working group? Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
