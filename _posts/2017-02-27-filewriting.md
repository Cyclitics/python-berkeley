### Info
Today we will be learning how to write to files in Python, and use the [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) library.

### Materials
The notebook can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3D_PdrFcBfRbXY3TTJjQVYtQ1U?usp=sharing), but be sure to download it right before class to ensure you have the most updated version! We are often working on these up until class begins.
