## Overview
Today, we will introduce the working group and go over expectations for the semester. Then we will review some basic command line prompts and introduce Python and its possibilities. 

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cMe-rSJRHpUDebl_aP78zQUJPL5Xzs0TS0k31gOGWt4/edit?usp=sharing).

Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
