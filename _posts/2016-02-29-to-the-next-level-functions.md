Come on **Monday, February 29 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today, we will go into certain &#34;to the next level&#34; functions and commands in Python that can make your work much more efficient. We will be building on the fundamentals discussion from February 22. There will also be time to discuss and share your own &#34;to the next level&#34; function.

Please do, at minimum, run through the [beginner tutorial](http://try-python.appspot.com) and try to follow the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer). If you get stuck, we can help: [email me here](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or stop by the D-Lab in 356 Barrows.


Today, we finished the [exercises by Software Carpentry](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.ipynb) and talked about some useful tools in Jupyter and Python. Kunal's notebook from today is [linked here](../to-the-next-level-2-29-16.ipynb), and a [pdf version is here](../to-the-next-level-2-29-16.pdf).
